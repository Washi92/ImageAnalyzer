The application will be implemented in Python, using the following libraries for the GUI development, image processing, and mathematical computations:

GUI Development:
Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python
CTkinter: Same but cooler UI

Image Loading and Display:
Pillow (PIL Fork): image processing library in Python that can be used for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats.

Mathematical Computations:
NumPy: library for numerical computing in Python.

Spline Interpolation:
SciPy: SciPy is built on top of NumPy. Provides additional functionality for spline interpolation. The scipy.interpolate module can be used for spline-based operations.

Exporting Data as JSON:
json module: for serializing Python objects to JSON format.

Exporting concurrent.futures
ThreadPoolExecutor: for asynchronous execution for loading thousands of images
